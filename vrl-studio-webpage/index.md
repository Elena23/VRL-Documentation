<p align=center>developed by Michael Hoffer @ <a href=http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de>G-CSC</a></p>


<br>VRL-Studio is an innovative Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Java Platform that combines both visual and text-based programming. In contrast to many other Development Environments VRL-Studio Projects are fully functional programs that are developed at run-time. This makes it an ideal environment for rapid prototyping, teaching and experimentation. <br><br>Click [here](./download.html) to download.

VRL-Studio is based on the Visual Reflection Library ([VRL](http://vrl.mihosoft.eu)). VRL enables declarative and fully automated creation of graphical user interfaces from Java objects. To accomplish that, VRL uses the information accessible via the Java Reflection API (see [Visual Reflection 1] & [Visual Reflection 2]).

Imagine how many line of codes you would need for writing a color chooser? See how it is done in VRL-Studio:

## Workflows ##

VRL workflows consist of `data connections` and `control connections`. Workflows can be used to create real Java/Groovy classes.

## Projects ##

A VRL-Project is basically a Java Library (.jar-File) that contains visually defined workflows, source code, compiled classes and optionally project related resources.

## Version Support ##

Each project is under revision control and contains a complete project history that contains all versions of the project.
